# BuyAPoster

BuyAPoster is a small, mock poster sample interface that I am in the progress of building using vanilla javascript and pure css(minus for some icons ofcourse, come on, they're icons!). The feature will allow users to make an asyncrohnus call to a random image api and then adjust the aspect ratio of the poster. Pleas see a sample fo the design below.
