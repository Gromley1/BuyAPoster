# BuyAPoster

BuyAPoster is a small, mock poster sample interface that I am in the procress of building using React, vanilla javascript and pure css(minus for some icons ofcourse, come on, they're icons!). The feature will allow users to make an asyncrohnus call to a random image api, adjust the aspect ratio of the poster and feature a hamburger drop down menu. Please see a sample of the design below.
